## How to ask Questions

>Place a rubber duck on your monitor and describe your problems to it. There's something magical about stating your problems aloud that makes the solution more clear.

I have a question and I'm writing it to someone... but not sending it. In the moment when
you 'transfer' the question from your mind to some medium (paper, email, chart, [thinking out loud](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThinkingOutLoud)) it turns on other parts of your brain and in next 5-10 minutes answer comes. Nine times out of ten. Amazing thing is that you find solution **themselves** and without spending time of **others**.

Note that 

Question shouldn't contains **NO/NOT** 

* do NOT know
* can NOT, 
* NOT possible
* NO time
* NO experience
* etc

Instead it should be *open* and contains 

* How
* Where
* How much
* Who
* When
* etc

Questions like

* Why
* What for

Dangerous because motivate to find guiltier. In case of addresses to themselves could drop you in deep recursive self-analyze

This effect among programmers called `Teddy Bear Effect` or [`Rubber Duck`](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking)

You may remember when you are starting describe problem to someone but instead find solution without any output from your partner. 

Let's summarize:

####Simple algorithm 

1. You have a question
1. Describe it in details to somebody how can give an answer, use some medium (email, chat, paper, etc)
1. All statement with **NO/NOT** replace with How, Where, Who etc.

####Example

Joe, I **can not** install this library to the project ?

Rewrite to

Joe, **How can** I install this library to the project ?

Re-read it and switch from the question to other activity: play in billiard, tennis, drink a cup of tea ...
or just go for a walk. The main idea is to not think about question. You even can take another task for a while.
If after 10-15 mins no any `insight` then you can ask question your colleges.

#####Use your mind on 100%

> Remember, if question appears in your mind, then answer already there, you just need to find it ...

## Time management

1. All your working day ( N hours) should be prepared and stored at your repository
2. During planing, please, take to account recommendations from this article
3. Don't spend more time on the task then it requires
4. Always clarify time dedicated for the task
5. Task has to be like "Do something in 5 hours" but not "Do something"
6. If you spend more time then expected then inform your mentor
7. Work on task before the first blocker. Once blocker appears inform your mentor as early as possible. If no any corrections/suggestions/instruction then switch to other task
8. Acceptable to spend some extra time to eliminate blocker themselves, let's say 10..30 mins.
Mentor desires if you have to spend more time
9. Write all completed actions and occurred problems. It would be ground for increasing time limit for the task
10. Try to complete as much tasks as possible
11. Absence of time isn't a reason in cases like: "I was working on task A that's why haven't done task B". Exceptions are 
	* dependent tasks, when incomplete A is a blocker for B. 
	* tasks with explicitly set highest priority where output is concrete result
12. Try to work evenly. For example you have a task for 6 hour but delivery is in 3 days, it's ok to split for 2 hours per day. Work on few tasks simultaneously each day by combining complex and easy tasks
13. Lear to effectively use time-frames for performing small sub-tasks. For example
	* build of the project
	* execution of tests
	* docs/email
	* TODO 
14. If you **naturally** can't work on few tasks simultaneously, don't hesitate and inform your mentor
15. There are 4 categories of tasks
	* urgent important
	* not urgent important
	* urgent and not important
	* not important and not urgent
16. If you have done all urgent and important tasks for current iteration, take a look in future materials and try to prepare sketch plan for it, then go back for learned section and read additional materials like articles,books or bonus tasks.

## Daily Plan and Worklog

1. Trainees create their personal `daily plans` at the end of the day or in the morning and put them to their repository.
1. A plan includes a list of tasks to be done on the following day. 
	* It is a good idea to mark higher priority tasks and put such tasks first. 
	* The plan should include estimation of how much time will be spent on the task.
1. Trainee should pay attention to individual plans provided by mentors. Tasks assigned by mentors have higher priority compared to the ordinary trainee program.
1. Mentors should perform daily check of the trainee's plan and correct it if needed.
1. At the end of the day trainees create `worklog` (daily report). A report lists what have been done, how much time was spent, any issues related to the tasks. All blockers should be clearly marked as well

## Prepare Your Status Repository

Idea is that all links to reports, tasks and projects would be stored in your status repository

1. First of all you have to [create account](https://github.com/join) under github
1. Find your mentor in forks for [js-eng-status](https://github.com/brotherhood-of-javascript/js-eng-status), clone mentor's repository and add link to your repo in README.md, don't panic [it's simple](http://screencast.com/t/sivkdBOaleuD)
1. [Create pull request](http://screencast.com/t/tmhdoF3ejrh) to mentor repo with your change

>Hint: I don't want **your** worklogs/plan changes in **my** status repo, push me only link to **your** repo

## Prepare Worklog and Daily Plan

It's time to make your first worklog and daily plan

> Make sure that you understand ['basic markdown syntax'](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)

#####Worklog

1. Find 'report/worklog.md' in **your** 'js-eng-status'
1. Put there are what you have done by today, the [sample](https://github.com/brotherhood-of-javascript/js-eng-status/blob/master/report/worklogs.md) could help you
1. Commit changes in **your** repo

> Your last report date should be always on the top of the page

#####Daily Plan

1. Find 'report/daily.md' in **your** 'js-eng-status'
1. Put there are tasks which wasn't done by today
1. Take a look in future material and put tasks which you are going to work on tomorrow
1. Commit changes in **your** repo
