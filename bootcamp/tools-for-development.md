##Text Editor vs IDE

It's a one of the biggest holly-war  between developer on what to choose...
My opinion you should have to learn **three** because they solve different tasks.

1. Text Editor
1. IDE 
1. Command Line Interface (CLI) Text Editor/IDE

> I suggest to use non IDE for first part of the course
> Also CLI text editors not required for this course , but nice to have

###Text Editor

1. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Atom
1. Notepad++
...

>I recommend to try Sublime Text, very fast and nice looking

###IDE

1. [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
...

###CLI 

1. [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
1. Emac 
...

>Vim is more like Text Editor and Emac is more like IDE
